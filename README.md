# **BPGv2-CCT**

This repository contains data and scripts associated with our manuscript, **"Pangenome insights into structural variation and functional diversification of barley CCT motif genes"**, currently available on **bioRxiv**: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.19.643958.  

## **Repository Contents**  

### **1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Files**  
- **`data/`**: Contains MSA files (msa) used for phylogenetic analysis (4tree) or for visualization (4ggmsa).  
- Alignments were performed using MAFFT/7.490 with default parameters.  

### **2. Phylogenetic Tree Data**  
- **`data/`**: Includes raw phylogenetic trees (tree) with bootstrap values.  
- Trees were inferred using IQ-TREE/2.2.2.6 with 1,000 bootstrap replications.  

### **3. Input Sequences for Synteny Analysis**  
- **`data/`**: Contains input sequences used for VRN2 regional synteny analysis.  

### **4. Scripts for Analysis & Visualization**  
- **`scripts/`**: Includes scripts for msa visualization (ggmsa), principal component analysis (pca), and pan-transcriptome heatmap (tpm_heatmap).
